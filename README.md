# Difficulty Estimation for Supervised NLP Tasks

This repo implements a difficulty estimation method using human annotations in supervised NLP tasks. The experiment details and results can also be found in our AACL-IJCNLP 2020 paper.
## Contents

* Scripts - code to run neural and non-neural classification/regression models
* jupyter_notebooks - same code, but provided in notebooks for convenince

## Experiments

### Regression


### Classification
