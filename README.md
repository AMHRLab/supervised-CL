# Difficulty Estimation for Supervised NLP Tasks

This repo implements a difficulty estimation method using human annotations in supervised NLP tasks. The experiment details and results can also be found in the paper "Towards a Task-Agnostic Model of Difficulty Estimation for Supervised Learning Tasks". If you use code in your academic work, please consider citing this paper. Link here.
